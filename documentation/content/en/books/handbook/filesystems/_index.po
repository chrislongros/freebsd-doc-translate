"File systems are a fundamental component of any operating system.  They "
"enable users to store, manage, and access data, making storage devices like "
"hard drives, flash drives, and USB storage devices practical for everyday "
"use.  Different operating systems use different file systems natively."

"FreeBSD has traditionally used the Unix File System (UFS), with the "

"File System (ZFS), known for its advanced features, robustness, and "
"reliability.  See crossref:zfs[zfs,The Z File System (ZFS)] for more details."

"In addition to its native file systems, FreeBSD supports a broad range of "

"varies, some require loading kernel modules, while others need additional "
