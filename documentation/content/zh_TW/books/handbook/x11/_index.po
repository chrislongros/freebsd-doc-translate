"The Ports framework provides the drm graphics drivers necessary for X11 "
"operation on recent hardware.  Users can use one of the following drivers "
"available from package:graphics/drm-kmod[].  These drivers use interfaces in "
"the kernel that are normally private.  As such, it is strongly recommended "
"that the drivers be built via the ports system via the `PORTS_MODULES` "
"variable.  With `PORTS_MODULES`, every time you build the kernel, the "
"corresponding port(s) containing kernel modules are re-built against the "
"updated sources.  This ensures the kernel module stays in-sync with the "
"kernel itself.  The kernel and ports trees should be updated together for "
"maximum compatibility.  You can add `PORTS_MODULES` to your [.filename]#/etc/"
"make.conf# file to ensure all kernels you build rebuild this module.  "
"Advanced users can add it to their kernel config files with the "
"`makeoptions` directive.  If you run GENERIC and use freebsd-update, you can "
"just build the [.filename]#graphics/drm-kmod# or [.filename]#x11/nvidia-"
