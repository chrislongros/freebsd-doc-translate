"When running on hardware that supports USB device mode or USB OTG, like that "
"built into many embedded boards, the FreeBSD USB stack can run in _device "
"mode_.  Device mode makes it possible for the computer to present itself as "
"different kinds of USB device classes, including serial ports, network "
"adapters, and mass storage, or a combination thereof.  A USB host like a "
"laptop or desktop computer is able to access them just like physical USB "
"devices.  Device mode is sometimes called the \"USB gadget mode\"."

"There are two basic ways the hardware can provide the device mode "
"functionality: with a separate \"client port\", which only supports the "
"device mode, and with a USB OTG port, which can provide both device and host "
"mode.  For USB OTG ports, the USB stack switches between host-side and "
"device-side automatically, depending on what is connected to the port.  "
"Connecting a USB device like a memory stick to the port causes FreeBSD to "
"switch to host mode.  Connecting a USB host like a computer causes FreeBSD "
"to switch to device mode.  Single purpose \"client ports\" always work in "
"device mode."

"What FreeBSD presents to the USB host depends on the `hw.usb.template` "
"sysctl.  Some templates provide a single device, such as a serial terminal; "
"others provide multiple ones, which can all be used at the same time.  An "
"example is the template 10, which provides a mass storage device, a serial "
"console, and a network interface.  See man:usb_template[4] for the list of "
"available values."
