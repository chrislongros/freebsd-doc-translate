"A class is built by creating a method table associating one or more "
"functions with method descriptions.  Before use the class is compiled.  The "
"compilation allocates a cache and associates it with the class.  A unique id "
"is assigned to each method description within the method table of the class "
"if not already done so by another referencing class compilation.  For every "
"method to be used a function is generated by script to qualify arguments and "
"automatically reference the method description for a lookup.  The generated "
"function looks up the method by using the unique id associated with the "
"method description as a hash into the cache associated with the object's "
"class.  If the method is not cached the generated function proceeds to use "
"the class' table to find the method.  If the method is found then the "
"associated function within the class is used; otherwise, the default "
"function associated with the method description is used."
